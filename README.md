# BiophysicalModel_SCSinSMA
 Biophysical Model use in Prat-Ortega et al 2024


This software has been developped in python 3.9 and NEURON 8.1.0.
Instructions to installed NEURON can be found in their wbsite: https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/.
Before using the software, modfiles need to be compiled as explained in https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/faq/mac


The Demo file simulates a population of Supraspinal inputs, a population of sensory afferent recruited by SCS and a SMA-affected pool of motoneurons for 5 seconds.
It plots the spike times for each population
